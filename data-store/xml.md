# XML

XML stands for eXtensible Markup Language that was designed to store and transport data that was independent of software of hardware implementations.

The XML language has no predefined tags. An example is shown below.

```xml
<books>
    <category>Fiction</category>
    <name>Ready player one</name>
    <author>Ernest Cline</author>
    <category>Biography</category>
    <name>Steve Jobs</name>
    <author>Walter Issacson</author>
</books>
```
## Why XML?
- As the name suggests XML is extensible. Most applications will work as expected even if new data is added or removed.
- It simplifies data sharing as it is platform independent.
