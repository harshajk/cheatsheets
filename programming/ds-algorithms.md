# Algorithms
An algorithm can be defined as a step by step procedure for solving a problem.

## Properties of an algorithm
An algorithm has five important properties:
- Finiteness
- Definiteness
- Input
- Output
- Effectiveness

One of the basic techniques for improving the efficiency of algorithms is to use an appropriate data structure.

## Techniques to design algorithms
- **Divide and conquer approach**: It is a useful for solving conceptually difficult problems.
- **Greedy approach**: It is more useful for solving oprimization problems under a given set of conditions.
- **Recursion**: It is a technique of defining the process using itself. It is used to solve problems that are repetitive in nature.
- **Dynamic Programming**
- **Brute-force algorithms**
- **Randomized algorithms**
- **Backtracking algorithms**

## Determining the efficiency of an algorithm
The rate at which the running time of an algorithm increases as a result of an increase in the volume of input data is called the order of growth of the algorithm.

The order of growth of an algorithm is defined by using the big O notation.

The different orders of growth and their corresponding big O notations are:
- Constant - O(1)
- Logarithmic - O(log n)
- Linear - O(n)
- Loglinear - O(n log n)
- Quadratic - O(n^2)
- Cubic - O(n^3)
- Exponential - O(2^n), O(10^n)

## Sorting Techniques
- Bubble sort
- Selection sort
- Insertion sort
- Heap sort
- Shell sort
- Quick sort
- Merge sort
- Counting sort
- Radix sort

## Search Techniques
- Linear search
- Binary search
- Ternary search
- Interpolation
- Jump search
- Exponential search
- Sublist search
- Hash

# Data Structures
Data structure is defined as a way of organizing the various data elements in memory with respect to each other.

Data structures can be classified under the following two categories:
1. Static: Example - Array
2. Dynamic: Example - Linked list

## Basic Data Structures
### Linear data types
- Array
- Stack
- Queue
- Deque

### Non-linear data types
- Linked list
- Tree
- Graph

## Advanced data structures
- Threaded binary tree
- Height balanced binary tree
